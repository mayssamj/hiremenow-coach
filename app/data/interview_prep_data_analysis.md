```

#### 4. Question_Tags Junction Table

    tag_id INT REFERENCES tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (question_id, tag_id)
);
```

#### 5. Company_Questions Junction Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE company_questions (
    company_id INT REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    question_id INT REFERENCES questions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    last_asked DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (company_id, question_id)
);
```

#### 6. User Progress Table (for the web app)
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_progress (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    question_id INT REFERENCES questions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    status ENUM('not_started', 'in_progress', 'completed') DEFAULT 'not_started',
    user_answer TEXT,
    confidence_level INT CHECK (confidence_level >= 1 AND confidence_level <= 5),
    last_practiced TIMESTAMP,
    practice_count INT DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Indexes for Performance:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_type ON questions(question_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_category ON questions(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_difficulty ON questions(difficulty);
CREATE INDEX idx_companies_name ON companies(name);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_progress_user_question ON user_progress(user_id, question_id);
```

### Key Features of This Schema:
1. **Flexible Question Categorization**: Supports multiple types and categories
2. **Tag System**: Many-to-many relationship for flexible tagging
3. **Company-Question Relationships**: Track which companies ask which questions
4. **User Progress Tracking**: Essential for interview preparation app
5. **Scalable Design**: Can handle large datasets efficiently
6. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency

### Additional Recommendations:
1. **Full-Text Search**: Implement full-text search on question_text for better search functionality
2. **Caching**: Use Redis for frequently accessed questions and company data
3. **API Design**: RESTful API with endpoints for questions, companies, tags, and user progress
4. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for user sessions
5. **Analytics**: Track question difficulty, user performance, and popular companies
